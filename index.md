LAB REPORT 1

I decided to test `cd` first without arguments and the absolute path before the command was run was /Users/diegoortega. The output I got was nothing since I didnt include any arguments after `cd`. The output isn't an error since the terminal doesn't explicitly indicate an error.

I tested `ls` after this without any arguments and the absolute path before the command was ran was /User/diegoortega. The output I got was all the files contained in the current working directory. The output wasn't an error since there were no explicit errors pointed out in the terminal
