LAB REPORT 1

I decided to test `cd` first without arguments and the absolute path before the command was run was `/Users/diegoortega`. The output I got was nothing since I didnt include any arguments after `cd`. The output isn't an error since the terminal doesn't explicitly indicate an error.

I tested `ls` after this without any arguments and the absolute path before the command was ran was `/User/diegoortega`. The output I got was all the files contained in the `current working directory`. The output wasn't an error since there were no explicit errors pointed out in the terminal

I tested `cat` without any arguments and the absolute path before the command was still the same `/User/diegoortega`. The output I got when using this command was the terminal waiting for me to type something into the terminal. This output wasn't an error as well since the terminal didn't indicate a specific error

Next I tested `cd` but this time with an argument, "Documents". The absolute path previous to this was `/User/diegoortega`. The output when the command was executed was nothing yet when we put the `pwd` command we see the change made since the absolute path went from `/User/diegoortega` to `/Users/diegoortega/Documents`. There were also no errors when this command was executed

I then test `ls` with the argument "Applications". The absolute path before this command was run was `/User/diegoortega/Documents`. The output whe the command was executed were the contents that were store in Applications which was Chrome Apps.localized. There were no errors when this command was executed.

Finally I test cat with the argument newfile.txt and newfile2.txt
